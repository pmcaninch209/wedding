           <div class="option"><div style="text-align: center;"> <h2>Accommodations</h2> </div>
            <p>As you all know, our wedding is in a rather remote location in the Sierra Mountains. It is approximately 2 hours from Stockton one way, so it can be a day adventure or you can choose to stay the weekend or night. We have come up with three great options for accommodations for both the night before the wedding as well as the night of.</p>

            <div class="option">
               <div class="option"><div style="text-align: center;"> <h3>Option 1: Bear Valley</h3> </div>
                <p>Bear Valley is located about 10 minutes from our wedding location. If you prefer a more resort or “hotel” experience, Bear Valley is open to reservations. Bear Valley Village has a few dining options as well as a small general store. To book reservations, you will need to call them directly, as we have found it’s difficult to book through their website. On their website, they do have pictures of these rooms. Please do not state you are with a “wedding party” - simply let them know you need to book a room for a nearby event. Rooms range from $175 and up per night.</p>

            <div class="option">
               <div class="option"><div style="text-align: center;"> <h3>Option 2: Tamarack Lodge</h3> </div>
                <p>If you prefer a more rustic, homey, or mountain feel, Tamarack Lodge has recently upgraded their entire property. Tamarack Lodge is located within walking distance (0.5 mile walk) from the wedding location. The lodge is similar to a large cabin and includes 9 rooms with multiple bed/room arrangements, including 2 single beds, full bed plus single bed, or full bed plus bunk beds. The bathroom is “dorm” style but still allows everyone to have privacy. Downstairs, there is a large kitchen, living areas with couches, a pool table, deck, and ping-pong. It definitely has a “family feel.” With enough people, the price may be as low as about $100 per person per night. Patrick is attaching pictures of this venue.</p>
                <p>If you decide to go with this option, please contact Patrick or me as soon as possible. Once we have enough people interested, we can let the lodge owner know. Please keep in mind that you will be responsible for bringing your own food. The lodge does have a refrigerator and kitchen. The closest dining would be either in Bear Valley, which is a 10-minute drive, or Arnold, which is a 30-minute drive back down the hill.</p>

               <div class="option"><div style="text-align: center;"> <h3>Option 3: Arnold</h3> </div>
                <p>The third option would be to stay in Arnold, which is about 30 minutes down the highway from the wedding location. There are quite a few motels/hotels in this area. There are also many restaurants as well as a grocery store. To book in Arnold, you would need to personally find where you want to stay and book it.</p>

                <p>Here are a few pictures of the venue because we have had some questions about the steepness of the terrain, keep in mind that we are still working on it and providing some sunshade and some base layer gravel type rock and tables but since a picture is worth 1,000 words here is 3,000 words worth of pictures so you can better have an idea of what to expect. We will have it all spruced up for the big day of course.</p>

               <div class="option"><div style="text-align: center;"> <h3>Parking</h3> </div>
                <p>There is limited parking close to the cabin that we would like to reserve for those who have difficulty with altitude or walking. The majority of parking will be held across the highway at Tamarack Lodge. We will be sure to have someone stationed at Tamarack to direct you where to walk to the wedding, along with signs and balloons posted. It will be about a half-mile walk on paved asphalt. The address listed on your invitation will take you directly to the wedding site; however, you can also punch in your GPS the address for Tamarack:</p>

                <h3>Attire</h3> </div>
                <p>Most of you should have received an attire card with your invitation. If not, it is because we assumed you were somewhat familiar with cabin living. However, just to reiterate, please do not wear high heels. Some of the ground may be dusty, dirty, or rocky due to gravel. Also, we are unsure of the weather, so please bring a jacket or even a change of clothes if you like. We consider the wedding to be casual; however, if you wish to dress along with the color scheme of the wedding, the colors are white, ivory, yellow, gold, and beige.</p>
